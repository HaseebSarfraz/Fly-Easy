## ✈️ Fly-Easy ✈️

This is an interactive and dynamic Airport companion mobile app that allows the user to store boarding passes, books hotels and restaurants, and track flights at their discretion. 

The tech stack used is a React Native frontend with a Flask backend to allow for efficient operations when requests are queried. The main focus aside from app functionality lies in the classical AI algorithms written for user inputs, and for general awareness of user surroundings. This includes greedy algorithm comparisons with the dynamic programming algos written to eventually produce stats. This project is more focused on creating a learning experience and perhaps providing a template in further pedagogical cases in UFT, maybe in AI classes or even more fundamental programming environments.
